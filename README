Planet
------

Planet is a flexible feed aggregator, this means that it downloads feeds
and aggregates their content together into a single combined feed with
the latest news first.

It uses Mark Pilgrim's Ultra-liberal feed parser so can read from RDF, RSS
and Atom feeds and Tomas Styblo's template library to output static files
in unlimited formats based on a series of templates.


We've tried to make sure you can get up and running in next to no time,
instructions are given in the INSTALL file.
